# There are five branches as follows: The models and data branch is the DNN, TL-DNN, PINN and TL-PINN models with the AM data and FEA data. The model prediction results branch includes different models' predictions for average thrust, thrust fluctuation , and coil copper loss. The model metrics comparison results branch includes the metrics results of all models. The hyperparameters optimization algorithms branch is the RS, GP, TPE, and SF algorithms for hyperparameters optimization. The hyperparameters results branch includes hyperparameters importance rusults and trail history of all algorithms.
