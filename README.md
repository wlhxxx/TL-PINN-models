# There are five files as follows: The models and data file is the DNN, TL-DNN, PINN and TL-PINN models with the AM data and FEA data. The model prediction results file includes different models' predictions for average thrust, thrust fluctuation , and coil copper loss. The model metrics comparison results file includes the metrics results of all models. The hyperparameters optimization algorithms file is the RS, GP, TPE, and SF algorithms for hyperparameters optimization. The hyperparameters results file includes hyperparameters importance rusults and trail history of all algorithms.
